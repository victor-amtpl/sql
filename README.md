# My SQL Query Documentation

## 1. Sample Query to Fetch Users

```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Email
FROM Users
WHERE IsActive = 1
ORDER BY Name;


### ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

- `#` is used for headers:
  - `#` = H1
  - `##` = H2
  - `###` = H3, and so on.
- Triple backticks <code>\`\`\`</code> are used for code blocks.
- You can specify the language right after the opening backticks for syntax highlighting, like `sql`.

Let me know if you want this styled differently or exported to a file.
